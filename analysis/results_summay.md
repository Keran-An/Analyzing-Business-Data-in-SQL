# Data Cleaning and Quality Assurance
- Duplicate Records:
  Identified and removed duplicate entries from the orders dataset to ensure the accuracy and integrity of analyses.
- Missing Values:
  Addressed missing values in critical fields (e.g., customer regions), applying standard imputation methods   (e.g., replacing NULLs with 'Unknown').

# Exploratory Data Insights
- Revenue and Profit Trends:
  - Revenue showed consistent weekly growth, with notable peaks during holiday periods (November-December).
  - Profit margins varied significantly by eatery, highlighting opportunities for targeted operational improvements.
    
- User and Order Growth:
  - New user registrations increased steadily month-over-month, reflecting effective customer acquisition strategies.
  - Monthly Active Users (MAU) exhibited moderate growth, suggesting stable user engagement.
 
- Product Analysis:
  - Meals with the highest costs did not always correlate with high revenue, suggesting areas where menu optimization could enhance profitability.
  - Revenue distribution per order was skewed, indicating a substantial revenue contribution from a small subset of high-value customers.

# Strategic Business Insights and Recommendations
- Customer Retention Opportunities:
  - Retention analysis revealed that a significant portion of first-time customers did not make subsequent purchases. Introducing loyalty programs or personalized marketing could effectively improve retention rates.

- Optimizing Profitability per Eatery:
  - Profit analysis showed substantial variability across eateries. Operational audits or sharing best practices from high-profit eateries could significantly improve overall profitability.

- Inventory Efficiency:
  - An analysis of stock data uncovered substantial surpluses for certain meals, suggesting inefficiencies. Rebalancing stock procurement and meal inventory based on demand forecasting could reduce costs.
